# REAPER

## The brother. The good boy. The blueprint.  

Reaper isn’t just a name. He’s a presence. A brother in every sense of the word, the kind of man who shows up when no one else does. Sharp-minded. Soft-hearted. Deadly in business. Loyal in life.  

This is a man who runs his world with precision and heart. A supporter of $UICIDEBOY$ since day one. The kind of best friend who remembers your wins, stands with you in your losses, and never lets you forget your worth.
